./align.pl [ -n AL_FACTOR -c ] reference hypothesis
----------
-n : which factor should alignment be based on
-c : do not ignore letter case
----------

Finds and prints to STDOUT the alignment between the reference and the hypothesis; both files are formatted just like
Moses's factored model training input: "string|string|string|...", with an arbitrary number and meaning of factors.

The AL_FACTOR argument specifies which of the factors is to be used for alignment; the default value is 0, which means
the first factor. In case a factor isn't present for a specific token (missing value), the aligner falls back to 0 for
that token.

Thus, out-of-the-box version aligns translations, based on surface forms (ignoring all other
factors). To align based on lemmas one has to generate a file with surface forms and lemmas, where sentences would look
like:

breaking|break the|the waves|wave .|.

or, thanks to the back-off mechanism, equivalently:

breaking|break the waves|wave .
