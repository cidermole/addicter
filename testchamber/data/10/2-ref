resumption of the session
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday , 21 september 2000 .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of the sitting on thursday , 21 september have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
madam president , i shall keep to the subject of the minutes .
for some strange reason , my name is missing from the register of attendance .
i would ask you to correct this and would at the same time take the opportunity to point out that it has been possible today to come here to strasbourg from finland in just nine hours .
that is almost a personal record for me this autumn !
yes indeed , mrs thors , we shall amend the minutes accordingly .
