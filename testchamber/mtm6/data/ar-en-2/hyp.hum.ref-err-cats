the miss~~man , who infl~~believes lex~~that infl~~he lex~~slipped and fell unconscious when he was trying to disembark from the mountain , he said , " I fell in lex~~a green zone and felt the warmth of the sun at the beginning and then lex~~fell lex~~asleep , " adding " this is lex~~all I remember . "  
the rescue team found miss~~Uchikoshi on lex~~the lex~~31st lex~~day of the last October .  
Dr . shaanxi Sato said that " lex~~His temperature fell below the normal level at the outset , similar to lex~~hibernation , " adding that " his brain was protected and has not been subjected to any damage and reord~~now lex~~is lex~~recovered 100 % . "  
and he lex~~was lex~~discharged out of the hospital to his home , the day before yesterday , Tuesday , after making sure lex~~he lex~~had recovered .  
and in Amman , hundreds of Jordanians , representing the opposition parties and reord~~Jordanian professional syndicates miss~~demonstrated today in protest against the visit of US President George W . Bush , according to miss~~what an Agence France Presse correspondent reported .  
shortly before the meeting between Bush and Al-Maliki the White House confirmed that lex~~Bush still supported the government of Iraqi Prime Minister , despite a document published in US newspapers miss~~that infl~~casts doubt on the ability of Nouri Al-Maliki to contain the violence .  
White House spokesman Tony Snow miss~~said in Riga , " We remain determined to help Al Maliki 's government to achieve its political , economic , diplomatic and security reord~~goals .  
lex~~our aim and our desire to help al-Maliki has not changed , " he said .  
the statement by the spokesman for the White House miss~~comes after lex~~the " New York Times " newspaper published a memo Stephen Hadley , President Bush 's national security advisor , miss~~sent to the White House miss~~expressing doubts in Al- Maliki 's ability to control the sectarian violence in the country .  
hadley said in the memo , published by the newspaper lex~~, that the intentions of Al-Maliki " look good when talking with the Americans , and sensitive reports indicate that he is trying to stand in the face of the Shiite politicians and miss~~make positive changes . "  
the memo added , " But the truth in the streets of Baghdad infl~~indicates that al-Maliki is either unaware of what is going on , or that he is lex~~misrepresenting his intentions , or that lex~~his capabilities are not yet sufficient to convert his intentions to acts . "  
President Bush on Tuesday reord~~refused reord~~to infl~~describe what is happening in Iraq , lex~~as the civil war , miss~~and he said that the escalation of violence recently is part of a growing sectarian violence , which began nine months ago lex~~. he refused to withdraw US troops from Iraq " before the completion of the task " in spite of the pressure exerted lex~~in the US .  
yesterday the reactions of the Iraqis lex~~continued on the report of the Committee lex~~of Baker Hamilton , especially with regard to the threats on the reduction of military and economic support to the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the event of miss~~its failure to achieve security and stability in the country lex~~. Mahmoud Othman , Deputy coalition Kurdistan parliament , miss~~said miss~~of the report that it is not fair .  
he added that Washington is calling itself an occupation force , and , according to the Geneva Convention , it should be the occupation authority reord~~fully responsible for the country .  
for his part , lex~~Basim lex~~Radha , the lex~~Al-Maliki adviser , lex~~expected the American administration lex~~wo lex~~n't lex~~abandon its role in Iraq and expressed his belief that Washington will not lex~~cut lex~~off military support lex~~before lex~~it lex~~can complete lex~~its mission in Iraq , he added that Iraq needed its support for progress . haidar Al abadi , of the Dawa Party near Al-Maliki , considered that claim to cut off support to the Government something new , he added , " We are all in the same boat miss~~fighting miss~~not miss~~an enemy internally lex~~but international terrorism miss~~. miss~~" but the lex~~deputy Zafir al Ani from the Islamic Party said : " I think that there are some of the procedures that must be adhered to by Al Maliki 's government in order to avoid the consequences of lifting support . "  
at the same time , Iraqi officials announced that Al-Maliki will listen to a brief presentation of the Committee lex~~of Baker , lex~~and added that the Iraqi prime minister will submit proposals to the American Administration on its policy in Iraq .  
in the early hours of yesterday lex~~from dawn , the US Congress lex~~adopted the miss~~final draft miss~~of miss~~a law miss~~that aims to isolate Hamas through the prevention of the US lex~~from infl~~helping the Palestinian Authority as long as Hamas infl~~does not recognize Israel 's right to exist and renounce violence .  
the demands of the draft law , which was prepared by the Senate and reord~~adopted reord~~by the House of Representatives during a vote by show of hands lex~~requires miss~~that reord~~Hamas lex~~have recognition of the peace agreements signed between the Palestinian Authority and Israel and prohibits the granting of visas to members of the Palestinian Authority as long as Hamas infl~~continues lex~~to lex~~lead the government and infl~~does not meet these demands .  
however , the draft law , which has become ready to be lex~~signed by US President George W . Bush infl~~allows lex~~for the continuation of humanitarian assistance , including food , water and medicines and assistance to enable the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas ( Abu Mazen ) lex~~in carrying out lex~~his duties .  
the draft law represents a reord~~slightly reord~~modified reord~~version lex~~of miss~~a draft law lex~~voted lex~~on by the lex~~Senate , lex~~which the miss~~Administration raised objections miss~~to and infl~~allows the administration to lex~~rally lex~~around the ban imposed by Congress on behalf of the national security of the US .  
in Tehran , the Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh during Friday prayers lex~~renewed lex~~the lex~~declaration lex~~of the Hamas Movement miss~~that miss~~it does not recognize Israel and confirmed that the Palestinian movement will continue resistance until the liberation of the occupied city of Jerusalem .  
he added that the international community and Israel demand that we recognize the rape of our land and to stop the jihad ( holy war ) and resistance , and respect the agreements signed lex~~previously , confirming that these things will never happen lex~~.  
the last Israeli war on Lebanon in last July lex~~devastatingly hit the Lebanese economy while lex~~it was recovering from a severe recession miss~~that began in the wake of the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik miss~~Al Hariri in February 2005 .  
and the war reord~~negatively reord~~affected all economic sectors , and the life of every Lebanese , directly or indirectly , miss~~undermining the monetary and financial situations in the country , and infl~~shaking foreign investor confidence in it .  
it seems that the economic consequences of this war will remain a strain on the shoulders of Lebanon for a long period of time , according to a comprehensive study on the subject issued by lex~~a miss~~private Lebanese Institution for Economic Research miss~~called " miss~~InfoPro . "  
200 lex~~medium-sized infl~~pages is lex~~what the reord~~study lex~~comes lex~~in , and it is miss~~published in the English language and infl~~bears the title " The economic impact of the July reord~~2006 reord~~war and steps towards recovery . "  
it lex~~goes beyond the provision of a comprehensive vision of the extent of the damage that has been inflicted upon the various economic sectors , as a result of the war , to show the miss~~practical ways to promote miss~~recovery in each of them , by the treatments offered to miss~~immediately activate its performance , as well as plans to achieve sustained economic recovery .  
during the days of aggression , and after the cessation of violence , the economic bodies miss~~as miss~~well as the public sector lex~~announced many estimated reord~~figures miss~~of the damage left by the war .  
and the lex~~inconsistency lex~~left observers in the confused miss~~state , lex~~when the ambiguity of the miss~~economic scene miss~~was miss~~surrounded lex~~by a lot of fogginess .  
the Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh received yesterday the final report of the European Union ( EU ) on the results of the reord~~European lex~~monitoring of the presidential and local reord~~elections ( last September ) during his meeting with the President of the miss~~union mission Baroness Emma Nicholson , who said that the elections were " very good and successful . "  
the official Yemeni news agency quoted Nicholson miss~~praising " " the elections , and lex~~affirmed that " Yemen has become a model for democracy and fair elections in the region . "  
lex~~she pointed out the Yemeni women 's participation in political and public life , and expressed lex~~her aspirations reord~~that miss~~women contribute more in future elections .  
in this context , Ali Saleh miss~~confirmed miss~~his interest and the interest of the Yemeni government lex~~in what was in the report of the mission of the European Union .  
he said that the report " will lex~~get lex~~the study and attention that lex~~it infl~~deserves , and we will take all the recommendations and observations contained therein seriously and miss~~with interest . "  
in spite of the fact that the European report included several remarks miss~~that spoke about the mistakes and breaches of the miss~~rules , attitudes and lex~~procedures of the supreme committee for elections and miss~~its management of the process , lex~~it praised the competition and the level of the presence of the parties in the infl~~direct reord~~supervision , control and management of reord~~the reord~~elections , in addition to the fact that the report lex~~considered " lex~~the minimum level of transparency and competition between the parties lex~~of the political process ( ruling and opposition ) , an important achievement . "  
President Bush reminds me of miss~~the proverb " lex~~Too lex~~much lex~~of lex~~anything lex~~will lex~~be turned against lex~~itself , " and he listened to the views of all people miss~~on miss~~the miss~~subject lex~~of the war on Iraq , to the extent that miss~~he decided to postpone his speech about any new direction miss~~change there miss~~from this month to the next month .  
everyone has heard the report of Baker - Hamilton , however , the President had received other reports this week , from the ministries of defense and foreign affairs , and the National Security Council .  
he was speaking directly with Dr . condoleezza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld , and listened to the military leaders , including the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and others from outside the government , and then made miss~~a lex~~closed-circuit lex~~television miss~~communication with field commanders in Iraq and reord~~divine lex~~communications lex~~through lex~~his reord~~open reord~~line to " lex~~Upstairs " .  
and lex~~between this and that he miss~~met miss~~with the Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi , and miss~~before miss~~him Abdul Aziz Al-Hakim , head of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , and miss~~prior miss~~to miss~~them lex~~with Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki .  
and reord~~all reord~~the above miss~~is lex~~either lex~~incidental or lex~~transient , miss~~but the lex~~permanent is the existence of 16 American intelligence infl~~services of government , miss~~each miss~~of miss~~which miss~~submits the private reports to the President , and collectively miss~~submits " the National Intelligence Estimate " each year , with the director of national intelligence , the miss~~newly miss~~created position occupied by John Negroponte , infl~~overseeing the work of intelligence .  
President Bush does not read , and if miss~~he miss~~reads lex~~he infl~~does not lex~~understand , and he listens and infl~~forgets , lex~~for lex~~words lex~~go lex~~in lex~~one lex~~ear and miss~~then find a way out of the other , lex~~while the President thinks miss~~about fishing at his ranch in Texas , where local opinion lex~~about miss~~him is miss~~that he lex~~is miss~~a " cowboy miss~~with miss~~a hat miss~~and without miss~~a herd . "
