Addicter currently uses some Dan's Perl libraries that are stored in a separate
svn repository. In future, there could be a cron job that will synchronize the
StatMT repository with the DZlib repository daily, DZlib being the master copy.
Then there will be a folder called (probably) $STATMT/perl/lib, and the users
will have to include a pointer to that folder in their PERL5LIB environment
variable.

Update 2011-09-06: I patched a dummy script that ought to do the above.
Let's see first if it works as expected.
