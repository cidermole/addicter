Addicter currently uses some Dan's Perl libraries that are stored in a separate
svn repository. In future, there could be a cron job that will synchronize the
StatMT repository with the DZlib repository daily, DZlib being the master copy.
Then there will be a folder called (probably) $STATMT/perl/lib, and the users
will have to include a pointer to that folder in their PERL5LIB environment
variable.
